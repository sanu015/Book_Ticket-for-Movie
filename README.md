# Book_Ticket-for-Movie
This project is a Movie Ticket Booking System built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to select a movie, choose show timing, pick seats from a theater layout, and book tickets dynamically. It's a front-end project that simulates real-world booking interactions without requiring a backend.
